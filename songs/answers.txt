    If I were to calculate the Audio Aura, I would consider the genre of the artists who are there in their top 100 and I would also consider
speechiness and tempo along with other things.
    However, this still would not give a perfect answer as we're attempt to make logical sense of emotions, we can get close but we can never
be spot on. Every individual is unique in their own right, for example, I listen to uplifting songs with high energy and temp when I am feeling
not so good, however, spotify would misjudge this as me being happy/ energetic.
