        Astrology becomes a kind of mythological psychology, a symbolic system that helps us make sense of our journey. It encourages reflection, provides language for things we’ve always felt but never articulated, and ultimately empowers us to live more intentionally. It’s not about fate, it is about insight. When we understand our inner patterns, we’re better equipped to make choices that align with who we truly are.
